'''
In this kata you will be given a positive integer, val and you have to create the function
next_pal()(nextPal Javascript) that will output the smallest palindrome number higher than val.
next_pal(11) == 22
next_pal(188) == 191
next_pal(191) == 202
next_pal(2541) == 2552
You will be receiving values higher than 10, all valid.

    next_num = val + 1
    while  str(next_num) != str(next_num)[::-1]:
        next_num += 1
